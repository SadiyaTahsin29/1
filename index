    <p>Problem Statement: Capacity building, performance assessment and motivation driven tool for faculty upgradation


        Description : If teachers were given more freedom, as would likely happen if a blended learning model were
        introduced as mentioned above, innovation would rocket, and an education system overhaul isn't exactly necessary
        to accomplish that. After all, there are (and will always be) plenty of options open to teachers to introduce
        more creativity and innovation to their lessons. Some of the options include Learning Management System (LMS),
        which allows teachers to create their own personalized, interactive courses from content provided by a range of
        publishers. Students can then access these courses on any device, while the app keeps a record of how they are
        progressing. If students are struggling. the course can quickly be altered. If students struggle with boredom,
        game-based learning can be introduced with LMS. Although granting teachers access to tablets and smart boards
        may help boost their comfort with education technology, many teachers simply have not thought about how they can
        best utilize technology in their curriculum. Indeed, the way a history teacher utilizes laptops in the classroom
        may be very different from the way a math teacher utilizes a smartboard. Both likely require plenty of time for
        trial, error, and experimentation to bring their lesson plans up to date. A major challenge in the adoption of
        new tools is not providing teachers with the guidance they need to make education technology work for them in
        their specific classroom. To overcome the challenge, it is necessary to have ERP solutions for the teachers with
        adequate credit mechanisms which can be used for appraisals and performance-based incentives to the teachers.
